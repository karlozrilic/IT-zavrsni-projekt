                        <h2>How to apply for the digital nomad residence permit in Croatia</h2>
                        <p>
                            Croatia is officially offering temporary residence to digital nomads effective January 1, 2021. 
                            You may know this by its colloquially name – the “digital nomad visa”. The introduction of 
                            this permit adds a brand new option for non-EU nationals to live in Croatia long term.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The revised law that regulates the immigration of foreigners (and introduces this permit) 
                            became official when <a href="https://narodne-novine.nn.hr/clanci/sluzbeni/2020_12_133_2520.html">it was published 
                            in Narodne novine</a>. Changes to the law are never official 
                            until they are published in Narodne novine.

                        <h3>The myth of the “digital nomad visa”</h3>
                        <p>The digital nomad visa is not a visa. It’s a residence permit.</p>
                        <p>
                            In Croatia, a visa refers to short stay for tourists. Depending on your nationality, you can 
                            either just show up in Croatia and stay up to 90 days or you must apply for a tourist visa from abroad, 
                            before you can enter Croatia. Some nationalities are only allowed to be in Croatia up to 30 days as tourists.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You can check <a href="http://www.mvep.hr/en/consular-information/visas/visa-requirements-overview/">MUP’s website</a> for all 
                            the requirements to enter Croatia as a tourist, as well as how long you can stay.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you wish to stay and actually live in Croatia beyond the term of your tourist visa, 
                            then you must apply for a residence permit. The new basis for digital nomads to get temporary residence 
                            in Croatia is therefore a residence permit, NOT a visa.
                        </p>
                        <p>“Well then, why is everyone calling it a digital nomad visa?”</p>
                        <p>Many countries in the world refer to both short and long term stays for foreigners as visas. Croatia is not one of them.</p>
                        <p>
                            Considering the worldwide hype around the introduction of a “digital nomad visa” in Barbados, Greece,
                            Estonia and elsewhere, the new Croatian residence permit has been automatically referred to as a 
                            visa, even though it is not one. I guess “digital nomad visa” rolls off the tongue better than “digital 
                            nomad residence permit”.
                        </p>
                        <p>The new law on foreigners (which we discuss in the <a href="#law-of-foreigners">next section</a>) never refers to a “digital nomad visa”.</p>
                        <p>
                            Will calling it a visa affect your ability to apply for it? Absolutely not. I’m just providing the correct information so 
                            that you can better understand Croatia’s system of immigration before moving here.

                        <h3>What the new Law on Foreigners says about “digital nomads”</h3>
                        <p>
                            The law that regulates the stay of foreigners is called “Zakon o strancima” in 
                            Croatian. <a href="https://narodne-novine.nn.hr/clanci/sluzbeni/2020_12_133_2520.html">This act</a> already 
                            existed prior to the introduction of the regulation of the stay of digital nomads. 
                            The update to the law is not just about digital nomads. It also includes a variety of changes 
                            including the introduction of a residence permit for Croatian diaspora and new rules for the 
                            regulation of permanent and temporary residence.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Now, we will go through what the law says about the long-term stay of digital nomads in Croatian, 
                            then English. Digital nomads are mentioned twice in the law.

                        <h3>Open questions about the digital nomad residence permit in Croatia</h3>
                        <p>Thankfully, most of our questions have been answered. This is what’s left.</p>
                        <h4>#1 How many times can you apply for this permit?</h4>
                        <p>
                            This is something that is not defined in the law, which means it is up to the ministry to 
                            decide on their own. The assumption is that this basis for residence will be treated just like the 
                            permits based on prepayment of rent, volunteering and ownership of real estate.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In practice, MUP is limiting the number of times you can apply for residence based on prepayment 
                            of rent and volunteering to 2 consecutive periods. Yet, for ownership of real estate, MUP is (in practice) 
                            allowing some people to apply repeatedly with no limit.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            On <a href="https://mup.gov.hr/uzg-covid/english/286212">MUP’s web site</a>, they say that the digital 
                            nomad permit cannot be extended, but it also says you must wait 6 months before you can apply for it 
                            again. Perhaps by “extended”, they mean extend the existing permit to stay continuously past 1 year. 
                            That would make sense based on their previous practices.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We won’t know how many times you can apply for this permit until at least the end of 2021, at the earliest. 
                            Most likely, we won’t know until 2022. For us to find out how MUP will handle this, we have to wait until 
                            the first people who got residence based on being a digital nomad in 2021 try to apply for this permit a 
                            second time. This won’t be defined in the law. It will be at the discretion of MUP.

                        <h3>What we do know about the digital nomad residence permit</h3>
                        <p>While the law defining digital nomads in Croatia is brief, what it does say is very telling.</p>
                        <h4>#1 We know the basic requirements</h4>
                        <p>There are standard requirements for all temporary residence permits, regardless of on 
                            which basis you apply. I’ll go over the requirements in the <a href="#temporary-residance">next section</a>.
                        </p>
                        <h4>#2 We know that you must leave for 90 days after it expires</h4>
                        <p>In Article 57, the law states:</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>
                                An application for regulation of temporary residence for other purposes or 
                                purposes of residence of digital nomads may be submitted by a third-country national 
                                after the expiry of six months from the expiration of temporary residence granted for other purposes 
                                or purposes of residence of digital nomads.
                            </p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>
                            To summarize, this means that 6 months must elapse between the expiration of your last permit and the day you 
                            start the application for a new permit. Since nobody can be here for 6 months without legal residence, 
                            that means you need to leave for 90 days after the expiration of your permit. Then you can return for up 
                            to another 90 days on a tourist visa.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After those 6 months have passed, you can then start an application for a new residence permit. This is also 
                            reiterated on <a href="https://mup.gov.hr/uzg-covid/english/286212">MUP’s web site</a>.
                        </p>
                        <h4>#3 We know the digital nomad permit doesn’t lead to permanent residence or citizenship</h4>
                        <p>
                            To qualify for permanent residence, a third-country citizen must live continuously in Croatia for a period 
                            of 5 years. By continuously, they mean that you cannot be gone more than ten months in total 
                            or once for up to six months during the 5-year period. This is defined in Article 150 
                            of the <a href="https://narodne-novine.nn.hr/clanci/sluzbeni/2020_12_133_2520.html">Law on Foreigners</a>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The exception is for third-country citizens living in Croatia based on family reunification. If you 
                            are considering the digital nomad residence permit, then this exception doesn’t apply to you.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Per the new law on digital nomads, there must be 6 months in between residence permits. Due to this, 
                            a person who has residence based on being a digital nomad will never qualify to apply for permanent residence. 
                            Permanent residence is requirement for citizenship if naturalizing. Therefore, it won’t put you on track for 
                            citizenship either.
                        </p>
                        <h4>#4 We know that you cannot legally work for any Croatian company</h4>
                        <p>In Article 3, a digital nomad is defined as:</p>
                        <blockquote>

                            The definition of a digital nomad in the law’s glossary clearly states you cannot work for 
                            any company registered in Croatia.
                        </p>
                        <h4>#5 Close family members may join the digital nomad</h4>
                        <p>
                            MUP confirmed with us that close family members of digital nomads can in fact apply for temporary residence 
                            based on family reunification. You will need to provide a marriage certificate (apostilled/legalized, translated, 
                            notarized) or prove that you are in a common law marriage as part of the application for spouses. 
                            Birth certificates must be provided for children.
                        </p>
                        <h4>#6 The permit is for up to 1 year</h4>
                        <p>
                            According to <a href="https://mup.gov.hr/uzg-covid/english/286212">MUP’s web site</a>, people can apply for the digital 
                            nomad permit for a period of up to 1 year. It is not possible to extend it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you only wish to apply for the permit for 6 months, you can do that. You just need to state that on your application.
                        </p>
                        <h4>#7 We know you can apply right now</h4>
                        <p>
                            As of January 1, 2021, it is in the law as a valid basis for residence. People can contact their local 
                            MUP station and request to start an application now. The first digital nomad has already been approved.

                        <h3>How to apply for temporary residence as a digital nomad in Croatia</h3>
                        <p>
                            In this section, we will walk you through how to apply for temporary residence in Croatia based on being 
                            a digital nomad (aka the “digital nomad visa”) including the requirements and steps.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Step #1 Determine where you need to apply</h4>
                        <p>There are three ways to possible:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                Everyone can now apply online <a href="https://digitalnomadscroatia.mup.hr/Pages/Zahtjev">here</a>, 
                                regardless of their physical location.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                If you need a visa to enter Croatia, then you can apply for this permit abroad at a Croatian embassy or consulate.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                If you don’t need a visa to enter Croatia, then you can apply for this permit at:
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Croatian embassy or consulate abroad</li>
                                    <li>Closest police station to your temporary address in Croatia.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>You can check if a visa is required for your 
                            nationality <a href="http://www.mvep.hr/en/consular-information/visas/visa-requirements-overview/">here</a>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The advantage to applying from within the country (if you do not need a visa to enter), is that you 
                            can be in Croatia up to 15 months at once – 90 days as a tourist, plus 12 months on the digital nomad permit.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Step #2 Make your desire to apply known</h4>
                        <p>
                            If you apply abroad, contact your closest Croatian embassy or consulate to ask for the requirements 
                            and procedure. The list of all Croatian embassies and consulates abroad can be 
                            found <a href="http://www.mvep.hr/hr/predstavnistva/dmkurh-u-svijetu/">here</a>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If applying from within Croatia, contact the police (Ministarstvo unutarnjih poslova aka “MUP”) 
                            in the jurisdiction where you plan to live within Croatia. At this station, there will be a service 
                            desk specifically for foreigners (“stranci”).
                        </p>
                        <h3>Step #3 Prepare your application</h3>
                        <p>
                            Below are the requirements you must fulfill to apply for the digital nomad residence permit in Croatia. 
                            These are the newest requirements published by MUP.
                        </p>
                        <p>The requirements for temporary residence based on being a digital nomad include:</p>
                        <ul>

                            <li>
                                Proof of valid private/travel health insurance policy that covers the entire term of your permit/the territory 
                                of the Republic of Croatia
                            </li>
                            <li>Proof of sufficient funds to support yourself</li>
                            <li>Croatian address</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Copies of documents can be submitted in Croatian or English language.</p>
                        <p>Let’s go through each requirement, one by one.</p>
                        <p className="bold">Application for Temporary Stay</p>
                        <p>An application form for temporary stay of digital nomads is called “Obrazac 1a” (Form 1a).</p>
                        <p>
                            This application will be provided by MUP or the embassy/consulate or you can download

                        <p className="bold">Proof of purpose</p>
                        <p>
                            Proof of purpose is a document that proves that you are a digital nomad. This refers to work contract or 
                            other document proving that you perform work through “communication technology” for a foreign 
                            employer or your own company registered outside of Croatia).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The ministry has defined exactly what you need to provide to show this. Keep in mind that every remote 
                            worker is different and may need to show different things. Below is what is listed 
                            on <a href="https://mup.gov.hr/uzg-covid/english/286212">MUP’s web site</a>:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Statement of the foreign employer or third-country national that the person performs work remotely through 
                                “communication technology”
                            </li>

                                Work contract or contract about performing job for a foreign employer (service contract)

                                Copy of the registration of their own company and proof that he performs the said tasks through his own company.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Some examples of what you could provide to cover these requirements include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Written statement/affidavit stating that who you are, what you do, whether or not you own a company, 
                                company information (if you do own a foreign company), what you earn, why do you want to be in Croatia 
                                and how long you want to be here. This must be translated into Croatian and notarized.
                            </li>
                            <li>Articles of incorporation of foreign company</li>
                            <li>Employment contract</li>
                            <li>Pay stubs</li>
                            <li>Freelance contract</li>
                            <li>Invoices along with corresponding payments from clients</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Essentially, they want to see that you are doing work and receiving income based on clients or employment 
                            that is outside of Croatia. Once you provide what makes sense for your situation, MUP will either accept it or 
                            come back to you with an additional request. What is required will be determined on a case-by-case basis.
                        </p>
                        <p>Be prepared to translate and notarize everything you provide.</p>
                        <p className="bold">Valid Passport/travel document</p>
                        <p>
                            Your passport needs to be valid, which means its validity period must be 3 months longer than the validity 
                            period of intended stay. You will most likely need to provide a copy of the passport, but sometimes they will 
                            make a copy at the police station. Take your passport with you every single time you go to the police.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If your passport is in a language that is not English, then you need a copy that is notarized and translated 
                            into Croatian.
                        </p>

                        <p>This is a brand new requirement for 2021. In Article 59 of the law, it states:</p>

                            Depending on your native country, this is likely easier to obtain while you’re still in your home country rather 
                            than once you get to Croatia. If you’re American, they want a federal background check, NOT one from your state. 
                            This is done <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/services/cjis/identity-history-summary-checks">through the FBI</a> and it

                            To qualify for residence in Croatia, you must have private health insurance coverage for the entire term of 
                            your permit (up to 1 year). You have the option to sign up for state health insurance after you are approved 
                            for residence, but it is not required as it is with other types of residence.
                        </p>
                        <p className="bold">Proof of sufficient funds</p>
                        <p>
                            You must prove you can financially support yourself during the term of the residence permit. Usually, MUP tells 
                            you how much you must have to qualify. The amount can vary as it is based on average salaries for the previous year. 
                            They will accept a foreign bank statement or proof of regular income to your account (for the last 3 months).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The government has decided that financial means of digital nomads must be equal to the amount of 2,5 times 
                            the average annual salary (based on 2019’s average salary of 6.457 kuna). The 2020 average salary has not 
                            yet been published.
                        </p>
                        <p>The financial means amounts for digital nomads are as follows:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>For a single person (e.g. yourself) = <b>16.142,50 kuna</b> per month</li>
                            <li>For each additional family member, add <b>645,70 kuna</b> per month</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            The amount of financial means for temporary and permanent stay in Croatia is defined by Regulation called 
                            “Uredba o načinu izračuna i visini sredstava za uzdržavanje državljanina treće zemlje u Republici Hrvatskoj”.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            New version of this Regulation was published in February 2021. It is 
                            available <a href="https://narodne-novine.nn.hr/clanci/sluzbeni/2021_02_14_273.html">here</a>.
                        </p>
                        <p className="bold">Croatian address</p>
                        <p>
                            You are required to provide your Croatian address when submitting the application. This address can be the 
                            address of your stay or intended stay.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you don’t have Croatian address at the time of application, you can use a temporary address until you have 
                            the address where you will stay during your residence. This can be an address of the hostel, hotel or 
                            accommodation if you have a confirmed reservation of your accommodation.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Step #4 Submit your application</h4>
                        <p>
                            For those that applied online, we assume you’ll receive email responses regarding your submission. This 
                            option was only launched March 1, so only time will tell how this process will play out.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you did not apply online, visit or contact the same police station/embassy/consulate you visited earlier 
                            to get the requirements and submit your application.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The attendant/rep/worker/officer (who knows what to call them) will review your submission to confirm you’ve 
                            met the requirements. If you have, they will accept your application for processing. If not, they will ask you 
                            for something else. Be prepared to be asked for something else, especially if it’s seemingly meaningless or redundant.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If your application was accepted for processing, make sure you provide a local phone number (preferably Croatian 
                            if you are in Croatia). This is how the police will communicate with you about your application.
                        </p>
                        <p>And now you patiently wait…</p>
                        <p>
                            The time to process your application can vary depending on the police station, the pandemic and a variety of 
                            other factors. Expect processing to take at least a month, during which you should not leave Croatia. Be patient. 
                            You are legal to be in Croatia during this time.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Step #5 Approval of temporary stay</h4>
                        <p>
                            Once approved, you’ll be notified either by a blue envelope to your address, a phone call to you or a phone call to 
                            your lawyer (if you’re using one). Presumably those that applied online will receive an email with the decision 
                            on approval.
                        </p>
                        <p>The further process varies depending on your scenario:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                If you applied online and were approved, you can use the received decision on approval to enter Croatia. 
                                Continue with the next step.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                If you need a visa to enter Croatia, then you must contact a Croatian embassy or consulate abroad. 
                                You must get your biometric residence permit/card or visa to enter Croatia. The request for visa can be 
                                submitted <a href="https://crovisa.mvep.hr/default.aspx?langId=en">here</a>.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                If you don’t need a visa to enter Croatia, then you can enter Croatia according to the regulations 
                                from the Law on Foreigners.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            It is important to note that you must register your temporary stay within days after your temporary stay 
                            or visa is approved if you applied abroad. Otherwise, your temporary stay will be revoked.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Step #6 Register temporary address</h4>
                        <p>Again, go to the local police station according to your address.</p>
                        <p>You need to provide:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Application form Obrazac 8b – You can download 
                                it <a href="https://mup.gov.hr/UserDocsImages/dokumenti/stranci/2013/Obrazac%208a.pdf">here</a>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Notarized rental contract, a statement from the landlord, or a title deed, or confirmation from a hotel, 
                                hostel or accommodation
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Step #7 Obtain a residence card</h4>
                        <p>Everyone must get a biometric residence card after approval of residence.</p>
                        <p>
                            Return to the police station with your passport photos. At this time, they will take your fingerprints 
                            and signature. You’ll also have to provide proof of payment of the administrative fees. In exchange for 
                            you giving them all these things, they will give you a white card. This is temporary proof of your residence. 
                            DO NOT LOSE IT.
                        </p>
                        <p className="bold">Passport photos</p>
                        <p>
                            Every country requires a different size photo, so best to get them in Croatia. Usually there is at least 
                            one shop that does passport photos right next to the police station. It can cost around 100 kn to get a 
                            package of photos.
                        </p>
                        <p>You don’t need to provide these until your permit has been approved.</p>
                        <h4>Step #8 Pick up your residence card</h4>
                        <p>
                            Three weeks from the day you got your little white card, you’ll be able to pick up your new residence permit. 
                            You will need to provide that white card along with your passport, which is why I said in all caps DO NOT LOSE IT.

                        <p>
                            Several amendments were made to the tax code and finalized on December 11, 2020. One of those amendments 
                            defines the income of a digital nomad and provides an exemption of income tax. We’ve translated this 
                            amendment for your reference below.
                        </p>
                        <p>The amendment states:</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>Članak 9.</p>
                            <p>(1) Porez na dohodak ne plaća se na:</p>
                            <p>
                                26. primitke fizičkih osoba ostvarene po osnovi obavljanja nesamostalnog rada ili djelatnosti za poslodavca 
                                koji nije registriran u Republici Hrvatskoj temeljem stečenog statusa digitalnog nomada sukladno posebnom propisu.
                            </p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>which translates to…</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>Article 9</p>
                            <p>(1) Income tax shall not be paid on:</p>
                            <p>
                                26. receipts of natural persons realized on the basis of performing non-independent work or activity 
                                for an employer who is not registered in the Republic of Croatia on the basis of the acquired status of 
                                digital nomad in accordance with a special regulation.

                        <p>You may view the full law <a href="https://www.zakon.hr/z/85/Zakon-o-porezu-na-dohodak">here</a>.</p>
                        <p>There are two things to keep in mind:</p>
                        <p>
                            #1 This is an exemption on working income. It is NOT an exemption on passive income. That means you are liable 
                            to pay tax to Croatia on passive income while you are a resident.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            #2 This exemption does not mean you don’t have to report your income made while living in Croatia to your 
                            home country. Make sure you know what your home country requires with regards to income made while living abroad.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For example, the United States of America doesn’t care where you live in the world. They require that you report 
                            your income annually, regardless of your location. You may also need to file an FBAR annually, which is 
                            a fun privacy-violating form just for US expats living abroad. Make sure you 
                            <a href="https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/report-of-foreign-bank-and-financial-accounts-fbar">know 
                            what an FBAR is and if you need to file one</a> because the penalties for not doing so involve prison sentences.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Self-employed Americans also need to know that you have 
                            to <a href="https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/self-employment-tax-for-businesses-abroad">pay 
                            self-employment tax to the US</a>, even if you live abroad full-time and even if Croatia doesn’t make you pay tax 
                            in Croatia.
                        </p>

                            Croatia <a href="https://www.porezna-uprava.hr/en/EN_porezni_sustav/Pages/double_taxation.aspx">here</a>.
