                        <h2>How to apply for the digital nomad residence permit in Croatia</h2>
                        <p>
                            Croatia is officially offering temporary residence to digital nomads effective January 1, 2021. 
                            You may know this by its colloquially name – the “digital nomad visa”. The introduction of 
                            this permit adds a brand new option for non-EU nationals to live in Croatia long term.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The revised law that regulates the immigration of foreigners (and introduces this permit) 
                            became official when <a href="https://narodne-novine.nn.hr/clanci/sluzbeni/2020_12_133_2520.html">it was published 
                            in Narodne novine</a>. Changes to the law are never official 
                            until they are published in Narodne novine.

                        <h3>The myth of the “digital nomad visa”</h3>
                        <p>The digital nomad visa is not a visa. It’s a residence permit.</p>
                        <p>
                            In Croatia, a visa refers to short stay for tourists. Depending on your nationality, you can 
                            either just show up in Croatia and stay up to 90 days or you must apply for a tourist visa from abroad, 
                            before you can enter Croatia. Some nationalities are only allowed to be in Croatia up to 30 days as tourists.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You can check <a href="http://www.mvep.hr/en/consular-information/visas/visa-requirements-overview/">MUP’s website</a> for all 
                            the requirements to enter Croatia as a tourist, as well as how long you can stay.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you wish to stay and actually live in Croatia beyond the term of your tourist visa, 
                            then you must apply for a residence permit. The new basis for digital nomads to get temporary residence 
                            in Croatia is therefore a residence permit, NOT a visa.
                        </p>
                        <p>“Well then, why is everyone calling it a digital nomad visa?”</p>
                        <p>Many countries in the world refer to both short and long term stays for foreigners as visas. Croatia is not one of them.</p>
                        <p>
                            Considering the worldwide hype around the introduction of a “digital nomad visa” in Barbados, Greece,
                            Estonia and elsewhere, the new Croatian residence permit has been automatically referred to as a 
                            visa, even though it is not one. I guess “digital nomad visa” rolls off the tongue better than “digital 
                            nomad residence permit”.
                        </p>
                        <p>The new law on foreigners (which we discuss in the <a href="#law-of-foreigners">next section</a>) never refers to a “digital nomad visa”.</p>
                        <p>
                            Will calling it a visa affect your ability to apply for it? Absolutely not. I’m just providing the correct information so 
                            that you can better understand Croatia’s system of immigration before moving here.

                        <h3>What the new Law on Foreigners says about “digital nomads”</h3>
                        <p>
                            The law that regulates the stay of foreigners is called “Zakon o strancima” in 
                            Croatian. <a href="https://narodne-novine.nn.hr/clanci/sluzbeni/2020_12_133_2520.html">This act</a> already 
                            existed prior to the introduction of the regulation of the stay of digital nomads. 
                            The update to the law is not just about digital nomads. It also includes a variety of changes 
                            including the introduction of a residence permit for Croatian diaspora and new rules for the 
                            regulation of permanent and temporary residence.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Now, we will go through what the law says about the long-term stay of digital nomads in Croatian, 
                            then English. Digital nomads are mentioned twice in the law.

                        <h3>Open questions about the digital nomad residence permit in Croatia</h3>
                        <p>Thankfully, most of our questions have been answered. This is what’s left.</p>
                        <h4>#1 How many times can you apply for this permit?</h4>
                        <p>
                            This is something that is not defined in the law, which means it is up to the ministry to 
                            decide on their own. The assumption is that this basis for residence will be treated just like the 
                            permits based on prepayment of rent, volunteering and ownership of real estate.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In practice, MUP is limiting the number of times you can apply for residence based on prepayment 
                            of rent and volunteering to 2 consecutive periods. Yet, for ownership of real estate, MUP is (in practice) 
                            allowing some people to apply repeatedly with no limit.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            On <a href="https://mup.gov.hr/uzg-covid/english/286212">MUP’s web site</a>, they say that the digital nomad permit cannot be extended, 
                            but it also says you must wait 6 months before you can apply for it again. Perhaps by “extended”, 
                            they mean extend the existing permit to stay continuously past 1 year. That would make sense based on 
                            their previous practices.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We won’t know how many times you can apply for this permit until at least the end of 2021, at the earliest. 
                            Most likely, we won’t know until 2022. For us to find out how MUP will handle this, we have to wait until 
                            the first people who got residence based on being a digital nomad in 2021 try to apply for this permit a 
                            second time. This won’t be defined in the law. It will be at the discretion of MUP.
